# ServerSync Plugin by AkramL
# Synchronize your spigot servers with proxies and manage them dynamically without extra configuration.

# A message broker is like a post office for computer programs, helping to send and receive messages to each other.
# It is important in this project to help with synchronizing servers between them.
# Available messages brokers for now:
# - REDIS
# - RABBITMQ (Not ready yet)
message-broker-service: 'REDIS'
# How many seconds between each heartbeat? (For spigot)
heartbeat-interval: 15
# The name of the current server (For spigot)
server-name: yourgamemode
generate-suffix: true

# Here, you can configure important values to use redis as a message broker.
# Ignore it if you are using RABBITMQ.
redis:
  # Credentials values.
  host: ${CFG_REDIS_HOST}
  port: ${CFG_REDIS_PORT}
  timeout: 5000 # In milliseconds.
  # Pool configuration values.
